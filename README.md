# 4Bridge

A platform that merges **philanthropy, DeFi, and liquidity**, transforming support for social projects with the power of the **Stellar blockchain**.
The platform allows users to support causes without giving up their principal capital, ensuring **full liquidity**, **fair distribution of generated yields** for social impact, and **radical transparency** of all operations.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem

Conventional philanthropy is still stuck in models that hinder large contributions and compromise results at scale. The main historical barriers include:

-   **Lack of transparency:** The destination of donated funds is unclear, undermining supporters' trust.
-   **Loss of liquidity:** Donated capital becomes irrecoverable, creating insecurity for larger and permanent contributions.
-   **Insufficient engagement:** One-time support models do not encourage recurrence or a culture of effective participation.
-   **Operational inefficiency:** Social projects face difficulties in maintaining a predictable cash flow, limiting planning and execution.

## üí° Solution

The platform converts **traditional donation** into a **programmable, sustainable, and traceable** model, with the following differentials:

-   **Full liquidity:** The user can fully withdraw the amount contributed to the vault whenever they wish, eliminating the risk of losing the principal.
-   **Impact via yield:** Only the yields generated by the vault are sent to the social projects chosen by the user, maximizing efficiency in resource allocation.
-   **Radical transparency:** All operations occur and are recorded on the **Stellar blockchain**, ensuring full traceability and auditability.
-   **Programmable yield split:** The supporter decides, at the time of contribution, what percentage of the yields will go to themselves and to the project, with the inability to direct 100% of the yields to personal benefit.
-   **Certificate of impact:** Each support automatically generates an NFT that symbolizes and eternalizes the user's participation and impact on the cause. (I MIGHT REMOVE THIS)
-   **Smart engagement:** A real-time dashboard facilitates the monitoring of yields, project status, and the history of the impact generated.
-   **Participatory governance:** Mechanisms for the community to influence strategic choices about the list of projects, yield policies, and new functionalities.
